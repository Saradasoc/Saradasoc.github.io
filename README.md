# CaseClicker
This is just a personal project. Almost all of the code is from [here](https://github.com/KingofKFCJamal/CSGO-Case-Clicker).

[Case Clicker (Saradasoc's Edit)](https://saradasoc.github.io/CaseClicker.html)

The features I have added include:
- Banking feature
- Sell all cheap items (sells items below $10 in your inventory)
- Added all Gamma/Gamma2 knives
- Added Gamma 2 case
- Added Cobblestone Souvenir Package (drop chances & case price may need tweaking)
- Autoclicker upgrade (upgrade cost may need tweaking)
- 2 Upgrades now have limits, key prices can be reduced to $1 (30 upgrades), and inventory space has a max of 200 (150 upgrades)
